                  <h2>PALLAVI RANJAN</h2>
                  <p>I like to think that I'm a very flexible and resourceful person. Even when things change at the last 
                      minute,I'm able to adjust accordingly and meet tight deadlines.I would say that I'm creative , hardworking
                      and detail-oriented.I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the task done.I would describe
                      myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I do.
                      I believe there is value in collaboration.I am confident in my ability to produce results.Of course,
                      situations happen when the results aren't ideal,and when that does happen,I do my best to tip the hat
                      in a positive direction.I don't let tough situations control me.Instead,I evaluate them and decide the best
                      result at that moment.The only way to keep moving forward is to focus on results. I am committed to adding value and reaching
                      goals with the best results possible.
